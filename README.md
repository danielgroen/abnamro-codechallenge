### Installation
1. `npm i`

### Run the application
1. `npm run dev`

### NOTES
- That with the attrToProp is a tryout actually to write better readable components
- Please don't judge the ugly css (not even scss). I didn't put the focus on styling
- Also, no formatters or whatsoever are installed to save time.. So if you see: 
  {{example}} instead of {{ example }}... That is the cause ;-)
  
- The favorites hasn't been set in a state management tool
- I agree on: yes this code can be much cleaner.. however to write the most pure clean code it'll just take time so out of scope here
